description: Migrate Vue component from frontend app to vue package
globs: 
alwaysApply: false

1. **Component identification**: Which component from `apps/frontend` should be migrated to `packages/vue/src/components`? (If not specified, ask for component name)

2. **Usage analysis**: Search `apps/frontend` for current component usage to understand implementation patterns for creating appropriate stories

3. **Migration execution**: :
   - **Do not migrate components that use API calls** to the `packages/vue` package
   - Components using `@utils/api`, `client.ts`, or any API-specific imports should remain in the frontend app
   - **Components using locale strings must accept translated text as props** instead of hardcoded locale keys
   - Remove `useI18n()` and `t()` calls - pass translated strings from parent components instead
   - Follow [vue-component.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/vue-component.mdc) guidelines
   - If possible, migrate dependent components and interfaces as well
   - If a component or interface depends on store (`apps/frontend/src/store`), pass this instead to remove the dependency

4. **Refactor**
   - Refactor all migrated components cleanly and sustainably
   - Make them accessible 
   - Document them using TSDoc
   - Keep their required functionality in the context of their use

5. **Finalisation**
   - Adapt the frontend application so that the migrated components are used
   - Suggest a commit message and PR description for our changes
