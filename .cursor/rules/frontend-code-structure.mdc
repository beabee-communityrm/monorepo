Whenever you write HTML or UI code, make sure to
- Mobile-first design approach
- Tailwind CSS styling with responsive design
- Accessibility with **semantic HTML elements** and **ARIA attributes**
- Focus management and keyboard navigation
- Touch-Friendly UI with interactive elements for easy tapping and **touch gestures** for common actions
- Include `role` attributes when semantic elements aren't sufficient
- Provide alternative text for images and icons (`alt` attribute, `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative)
- Maintain logical focus order and visible focus indicators
