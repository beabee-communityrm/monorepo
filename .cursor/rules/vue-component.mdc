# Vue Components

## Creating component
- Follow patterns from existing components in `packages/vue/src/components`
- Create a corresponding `.story.vue` file
- Vue package components must be application-independent applicable without API dependencies

## Create story
- Following existing story patterns in `packages/vue/src/components/**/*.story.*`
- Add brief documentation as a `.story.md` file following existing documentation structure
- Do not document anything that is already documented in the source code
- Avoid duplicating documentation that is already documented in the source code; instead, refer to existing documentation

## Modify component
- Adjust the story and documentation as necessary.

## Mobile-First Design
- **Design for mobile screens first**, then scale up to larger screens.
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

## Touch-Friendly UI
- Make interactive elements (buttons, links) for easy tapping.
- Implement **touch gestures** for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) where appropriate.

## Accessibility
- Use **semantic HTML elements** and **ARIA attributes** where necessary.
- Implement **keyboard navigation support**.
- Include `role` attributes when semantic elements aren't sufficient
- Provide alternative text for images and icons (`alt` attribute, `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative)
- Maintain logical focus order and visible focus indicators
- Ensure proper **color contrast ratios** using Tailwind's `text-*` and `bg-*` classes.
