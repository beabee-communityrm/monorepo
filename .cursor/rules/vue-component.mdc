# Vue Components

## When creating new Vue component
- Follow patterns from existing components in `packages/vue/src/components`
- Create a corresponding `.story.vue` file following existing story patterns
- Add brief documentation as a `.story.md` file following existing documentation structure

## API Dependencies
- **Do not migrate components that use API calls** to the `packages/vue` package
- Components using `@utils/api`, `client.ts`, or any API-specific imports should remain in their current location
- Vue package components must be universally applicable without API dependencies
- **Components using locale strings must accept translated text as props** instead of hardcoded locale keys
- Remove `useI18n()` and `t()` calls - pass translated strings from parent components instead

## Mobile-First Design
- **Design for mobile screens first**, then scale up to larger screens.
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

## Touch-Friendly UI
- Make interactive elements (buttons, links) for easy tapping.
- Implement **touch gestures** for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) where appropriate.

## Accessibility
- Use **semantic HTML elements** and **ARIA attributes** where necessary.
- Implement **keyboard navigation support**.
- Include `role` attributes when semantic elements aren't sufficient
- Provide alternative text for images and icons (`alt` attribute, `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative)
- Maintain logical focus order and visible focus indicators
- Ensure proper **color contrast ratios** using Tailwind's `text-*` and `bg-*` classes.
