Migrate Vue component from frontend app to vue package:

1. **Component identification**: Which component from `apps/frontend` should be migrated to `packages/vue/src/components`? (If not specified, ask for component name)

2. **Usage analysis**: Search `apps/frontend` for current component usage to understand implementation patterns for creating appropriate stories

3. **Migration execution**: :
   - Follow [vue-component.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/vue-component.mdc) guidelines
