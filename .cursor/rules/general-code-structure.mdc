Whenever you write code, make sure to
- Write complete code blocks
- Provide concise answers assuming programming knowledge
- Read missing source code yourself to give quality answers
- use ESM imports and exports for TypeScript code
- define interface in a separate file
- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
- document the code
- when writing documentation, prefer doing it directly in code; if creating additional documentation, reference existing documentation instead of rewriting it
- use English for comments, documentation and code
- use common and understandable variable, method and component names
- orientate yourself on the existing code base to remain consistent with the existing code base
- Use the latest versions of the source code so that you do not overwrite manual adjustments
