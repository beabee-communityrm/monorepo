Whenever you write code, make sure to
- Write complete code blocks
- Provide concise answers assuming programming knowledge
- Read missing source code yourself to give quality answers
- Orientate yourself on the existing code base to remain consistent with the existing code base
- Use ESM imports and exports for TypeScript code
- Define interface in a separate file
- Modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Document the code
- When writing documentation, prefer doing it directly in code
- Reference existing documentation instead of rewriting it
- Use English for comments, documentation and code
- Use common and understandable variable, method and component names
- Use the latest versions of the source code so that you do not overwrite manual adjustments
