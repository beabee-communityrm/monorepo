Scaffold a new TypeScript vanilla package within our monorepo workspace.

## Prerequisites
- Identify target package information (ask if not specified)
- If the package is intended for the backend or requires CommonJS support, this template is not suitable. Use a different package that uses CommonJS as a template instead.

## Implementation
- Use the `packages/template-vanilla` package conventions for structure, naming, tsconfig, and package.json
- Read the [README.md](mdc:packages/template-vanilla/README.md) of the template and follow the instructions outlined therein
