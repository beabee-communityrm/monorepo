# Beabee Monorepo

Welcome to the official Beabee Monorepo! This repository houses the most important components of the Beabee project, including the backend API, frontend application, and shared libraries.

## Project Structure

The Beabee Monorepo is organized into the following directories:

- `apps/`

  - `frontend/`: Contains the code for the frontend application. See [Frontend README](apps/frontend/README.md) for more information.
  - `backend/`: Contains the code for the backend API. See [Backend README](apps/backend/README.md) for more information.
  - `router/`: Contains the code for the new frontend router. See [Router README](apps/router/README.md) for more information.

- `packages/`
  - `common/`: Contains shared code and utilities used by both the frontend and backend. See [Common Package README](packages/common/README.md) for more information.
  - `core/`: Contains shared core functionality used by the backend. See [Core Package README](packages/core/README.md) for more information.

> If you want to deploy beabee on a server refer to
> [beabee/beabee-deploy](https://github.com/beabee-communityrm/beabee-deploy/)
> instead. The instructions below are for running beabee locally for development

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Docker >= 19.03.8
- Docker Compose >= 2
- Node.js >= 20.10.0
- Yarn >= 1.22.22 (automatically uses the Yarn version from the repo)

### Initial Setup

1. Install dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the bootstrap script to copy the example environment files:

   ```bash
   yarn bootstrap
   ```
3. Complete the `.env` file in your root by setting the required environment variables.
   
   See the [Environment Variables Documentation](docs/environment-variables.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

4. Build the project locally:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

5. Run the setup script to create a new user and configure the payment method and email domain:

   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```

6. Start the Docker Compose stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

7. Run the development mode to watch for changes on all packages:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.

8. Happy coding!

### Visual Studio Code Workspace

If you want to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor, you can use the provided `.vscode/beabee.code-workspace` file to open the project in a workspace. This will allow you to have a single, unified view of the project, including all the necessary settings and extensions:

```bash
code .vscode/beabee.code-workspace
```

#### Access Points:

The Beabee project uses several ports for different services in development mode:

- **Frontend development**: http://localhost:3000 (Vite dev server with HMR)
- **Router (production-like)**: http://localhost:3002 (Docker Compose)
- **MailDev interface**: http://localhost:3025 (Email testing)

> **Recommended**: Use the Vite development server (port 3000) for frontend development to get hot module replacement and modern development features.

For detailed port configuration and environment variable setup, see the [Environment Variables Documentation](docs/environment-variables.md).

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines several services, including:

- `db`: PostgreSQL database
- `mail`: MailDev for email testing
- `app`: Backend application
- `api_app`: API application
- `webhook_app`: Webhook handling application
- `img_upload_app`: Image upload service
- `cron`: Cron job service
- `frontend`: Frontend application
- `app_router`: Router for the frontend and backend

The frontend service is configured to use the `BEABEE_AUDIENCE` environment variable for API requests.

For more detailed information about each service and its configuration, please refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory.

### Development Mode

The `yarn dev` command starts the development mode for all packages in the monorepo. Here's what happens when you run this command:

#### Root Project

The root `yarn dev` command runs the dev scripts for all workspaces in parallel:

```bash
yarn workspaces foreach -v -W -p -i run dev
```

#### Backend

For the backend, `yarn dev` is an alias for `yarn dev:api`, which does the following:
1. Builds the project
2. Restarts the Docker Compose services
3. Runs three concurrent processes:
   - Watches for TypeScript changes and rebuilds
   - Watches for asset changes
   - Streams logs from the Docker containers

#### Frontend

The frontend's `yarn dev` command starts the Vite development server:

```bash
vite
```

This provides hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid development.

#### Common Package

For the common package, `yarn dev` is an alias for `yarn watch`, which runs concurrent watch processes for:
- Node.js ESM and CJS builds
- Browser builds
- TypeScript type definitions

#### Core Package

The core package's `yarn dev` command runs a TypeScript watch process:

```bash
tsc-watch --noClear -p tsconfig.build.json
```

This continuously compiles TypeScript files as they change.

By running `yarn dev` in the root of the project, you start development processes for all these packages simultaneously, allowing you to work on different parts of the project with live reloading and quick feedback.

## TypeScript Configuration

The Beabee Monorepo uses a sophisticated TypeScript configuration system with shared configurations provided by the [`@beabee/tsconfig`](packages/tsconfig/README.md) package. This ensures proper type checking and module resolution across all packages in the monorepo.

For detailed information about TypeScript configurations, including:
- Available configurations (server, frontend, vanilla)
- Dual tsconfig structure
- TypeScript references
- Guidelines for new packages

Please refer to the [TypeScript Configuration Documentation](packages/tsconfig/README.md).

### Other Developer Tools

Check and upgrade all dependencies:

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

Publish new versions of the library packages on NPM:

```bash
yarn publish:latest # or yarn publish:next
```

Run the format command on all packages to format the code:

```bash
yarn format
```
