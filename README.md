# Beabee Monorepo

Welcome to the official Beabee Monorepo! This repository houses the most important components of the Beabee project, including the backend API, frontend application, and shared libraries.

## Project Structure

The Beabee Monorepo is organized into the following directories:

- `apps/` Contains the applications.
  - `frontend/`: Contains the code for the frontend application.
  - `backend/`: Contains the code for the backend API.
  - `task-runner-worker/`: Contains the code for the task runner worker.
  - `task-runner-dashboard/`: Contains the code for the task runner dashboard.
  - `cli/`: Contains the code for the CLI.

- `packages/` Contains packages used by the applications.
  - `common/`: Contains shared code and utilities used by both the frontend and backend.
  - `config/`: Contains the configuration for the application.
  - `core/`: Contains the core code for the application.
  - `locales/`: Contains the localization files for the application.
  - `models/`: Contains the TypeORM database models for the application.
  - `task-runner/`: Contains shared code for the task runner used by `task-runner-worker`, `task-runner-dashboard` and the `backend`.

- `docker/`: Contains the Docker configurations.
  - `deno-node/`: Contains the Docker configuration for the Deno + Node.js environment.
  - `workspace/`: Contains the Docker configuration for the workspace builder to build everything in the monorepo and to copy them into the application containers.

## Development Setup

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Docker >= 19.03.8
- Docker Compose >= 2
- Node.js >= 20.10.0
- Yarn >= 1.22.22
- Deno >= 1.38.1

### Initial Setup

1. Copy the example environment files:

   ```bash
   cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
   cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn build
   ```

3. Initialize and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   # Build all docker images
   yarn docker:build:local
   # Build the docker-compose stack
   yarn docker-compose:build
   ```

   > You can also start the containers with `yarn docker:start:local`

4. Run the development mode to watch for changes on all packages:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Developer Tools

Check and upgrade all dependencies:

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

Publish new versions of the library packages on NPM:

```bash
yarn publish:latest # or yarn publish:next
```

Run the format command on all packages to format the code:

```bash
yarn format
```

Visual Studio Code Workspace:

If you want to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor, you can use the provided `.vscode/beabee.code-workspace` file to open the project in a workspace. This will allow you to have a single, unified view of the project, including all the necessary settings and extensions:

```bash
code .vscode/beabee.code-workspace
```

## Backend
