# Beabee Monorepo

Welcome to the official Beabee Monorepo! This repository houses the most important components of the Beabee project, including the backend API, frontend application, and shared libraries.

## Project Structure

The Beabee Monorepo is organized into the following directories:

- `apps/`

  - `frontend/`: Contains the code for the frontend application. See [Frontend README](apps/frontend/README.md) for more information.
  - `backend/`: Contains the code for the backend API. See [Backend README](apps/backend/README.md) for more information.
  - `router/`: Contains the code for the new frontend router. See [Router README](apps/router/README.md) for more information.

- `packages/`
  - `common/`: Contains shared code and utilities used by both the frontend and backend. See [Common Package README](packages/common/README.md) for more information.
  - `core/`: Contains shared core functionality used by the backend. See [Core Package README](packages/core/README.md) for more information.

## Development Setup

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Docker >= 19.03.8
- Docker Compose >= 2
- Node.js >= 20.10.0
- Yarn >= 1.22.22 (automatically uses the Yarn version from the repo)
- Deno >= 2.0.3

### Initial Setup

1. Install dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the presetup script to copy the example environment files:

   ```bash
   yarn presetup
   ```
3. Complete the .env in your root by setting the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   BEABEE_STRIPE_PUBLICKEY=...
   BEABEE_STRIPE_SECRETKEY=...
   BEABEE_STRIPE_WEBHOOKSECRET=...
   BEABEE_STRIPE_MEMBERSHIPPRODUCTID=...
   ```

4. Build the project locally:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

5. Build the Docker Compose stack:

   ```bash
   yarn docker:compose:build
   ```

6. Start the Docker Compose stack:

   ```bash
   yarn docker:compose:up
   ```

7. Run the setup script to create a new user and configure the payment method and email domain:

   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3025 to access MailDev to confirm the email address you used for the setup script.

8. Run the development mode to watch for changes on all packages:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.

9. Happy coding!

### Visual Studio Code Workspace

If you want to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor, you can use the provided `.vscode/beabee.code-workspace` file to open the project in a workspace. This will allow you to have a single, unified view of the project, including all the necessary settings and extensions:

```bash
code .vscode/beabee.code-workspace
```

#### Ports:

The Beabee project uses several ports for different services in development mode:

- `3000`: Frontend development server (Vite)
- `3002`: Router for the new frontend and legacy backend
- `3025`: MailDev for email testing (defined by MAIL_PORT in .env)
- `6543`: PostgreSQL database (mapped from container's 5432)

As you can see, you can access the frontend via two different URLs:

- Via Vite dev server + proxy (http://localhost:3000)
- Router over Docker Compose (http://localhost:3002)

The recommended way for frontend development is to use the Vite development server (http://localhost:3000), as this will give you hot module replacement (HMR) and other modern development features.

Accessing the frontend through the router (http://localhost:3002) mimics more closely the production environment and can be used to test if the access works as it will be delivered later. This is useful for verifying the production-like behavior during development.

When running the project, make sure these ports are available on your local machine. You can access different parts of the application using these URLs:

- Frontend development: http://localhost:3000
- Router (frontend and backend): http://localhost:3002
- MailDev interface: http://localhost:3025

Note: The actual ports used may vary based on your specific .env configuration. Always refer to your local .env file for the most accurate port settings.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines several services, including:

- `db`: PostgreSQL database
- `mail`: MailDev for email testing
- `app`: Backend application
- `api_app`: API application
- `webhook_app`: Webhook handling application
- `img_upload_app`: Image upload service
- `cron`: Cron job service
- `frontend`: Frontend application
- `app_router`: Router for the frontend and backend

The frontend service is configured to use the `APP_BASE_URL` environment variable, which is set to `http://localhost:3002` by default.

For more detailed information about each service and its configuration, please refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory.

### Development Mode

The `yarn dev` command starts the development mode for all packages in the monorepo. Here's what happens when you run this command:

#### Root Project

The root `yarn dev` command runs the dev scripts for all workspaces in parallel:

```bash
yarn workspaces foreach -v -W -p -i run dev
```

#### Backend

For the backend, `yarn dev` is an alias for `yarn dev:api`, which does the following:
1. Builds the project
2. Restarts the Docker Compose services
3. Runs three concurrent processes:
   - Watches for TypeScript changes and rebuilds
   - Watches for asset changes
   - Streams logs from the Docker containers

#### Frontend

The frontend's `yarn dev` command starts the Vite development server:

```bash
vite
```

This provides hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid development.

#### Common Package

For the common package, `yarn dev` is an alias for `yarn watch`, which runs concurrent watch processes for:
- Node.js ESM and CJS builds
- Browser builds
- TypeScript type definitions

#### Core Package

The core package's `yarn dev` command runs a TypeScript watch process:

```bash
tsc-watch --noClear -p tsconfig.build.json
```

This continuously compiles TypeScript files as they change.

By running `yarn dev` in the root of the project, you start development processes for all these packages simultaneously, allowing you to work on different parts of the project with live reloading and quick feedback.

### Other Developer Tools

Check and upgrade all dependencies:

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

Publish new versions of the library packages on NPM:

```bash
yarn publish:latest # or yarn publish:next
```

Run the format command on all packages to format the code:

```bash
yarn format
```
