# Beabee Monorepo

Welcome to the official Beabee Monorepo! This repository houses the most important components of the Beabee project, including the backend API, frontend application, and shared libraries.

## Project Structure

The Beabee Monorepo is organized into the following directories:

- `apps/` Contains the applications.
  - `frontend/`: Contains the code for the frontend application.
  - `backend/`: Contains the code for the backend API.
  - `task-runner-worker/`: Contains the code for the task runner worker.
  - `task-runner-dashboard/`: Contains the code for the task runner dashboard.
  - `cli/`: Contains the code for the CLI.

- `packages/` Contains packages used by the applications.
  - `common/`: Contains shared code and utilities used by both the frontend and backend.
  - `config/`: Contains the configuration for the application.
  - `core/`: Contains the core code for the application.
  - `locales/`: Contains the localization files for the application.
  - `models/`: Contains the TypeORM database models for the application.
  - `task-runner/`: Contains shared code for the task runner used by `task-runner-worker`, `task-runner-dashboard` and the `backend`.

- `docker/`: Contains the Docker configurations.
  - `deno-node/`: Contains the Docker configuration for the Deno + Node.js environment.
  - `workspace/`: Contains the Docker configuration for the workspace builder to build everything in the monorepo and to copy them into the application containers.

## Development Setup

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Docker >= 19.03.8
- Docker Compose >= 2
- Node.js >= 20.10.0
- Yarn >= 1.22.22
- Deno >= 1.38.1

### Initial Setup

1. Install dependencies, copy the example environment files and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn setup # This prepares packages, for example, the .env.example is copied to .env if necessary
   yarn build
   ```

2. Initialize and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   yarn docker:build:local # Build all docker images for the local environment
   yarn docker-compose:build # Build the docker-compose stack for the local environment
   ```

   > You can also start the containers with `yarn docker:start:local`

3. Run the development mode to watch for changes on all packages:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Developer Tools

Check and upgrade all dependencies:

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

Publish new versions of the library packages on NPM:

```bash
yarn publish:latest # or yarn publish:next
```

Publish new versions of the Docker images to Docker Hub (Normally not necessary, as this is done automatically via a GitHub action):

```bash
yarn docker:push:latest # or yarn docker:push:dev
```

Run the format command on all packages to format the code:

```bash
yarn format
```

Check for linting and type checking errors on all packages:

```bash
yarn check
```

Run the tests on all packages:

```bash
yarn test
```

Some packages use Deno. To ensure that they still work with the `yarn workspace`, they still contain a `package.json` that is synchronised with the `deno.jsonc`. To synchronise these with each other, run:

```bash
yarn sync
```

> To see what other scripts are available and what they do, take a look at the `package.json` files for the root and subprojects.

Visual Studio Code Workspace:

If you want to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor, you can use the provided `.vscode/beabee.code-workspace` file to open the project in a workspace. This will allow you to have a single, unified view of the project, including all the necessary settings and extensions:

```bash
code .vscode/beabee.code-workspace
```

## Backend

For detailed information on the backend setup, including database migrations and running specific tools, please refer to the [Backend README](apps/backend/README.md).

## Frontend

For detailed information on the frontend setup, including internationalization and development commands, please refer to the [Frontend README](apps/frontend/README.md).

## Common Package

The `beabee-common` package contains shared code utilized across Beabee projects, compatible with Node.js, Deno, and web browsers.
For more information, please refer to the [Common Package README](packages/common/README.md).
