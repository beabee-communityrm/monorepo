This project uses yarn workspaces, the project-internal yarn packages are stored in the folders `packages/` and `apps/`, where only the packages in the folder `packages/` should be imported. If files are to be imported from one package into an app or another package, the package name must be used for this purpose.

We currently have the following yarn packages which can be imported:
- `@beabee/client` in `packages/client/package.json`
- `@beabee/beabee-common` in `packages/common/package.json`
- `@beabee/core` in `packages/core/package.json`
- `@beabee/prettier-config` in `packages/prettier-config/package.json`
- `@beabee/test-utils` in `packages/test-utils/package.json`
- `@beabee/tsconfig` in `packages/tsconfig/package.json`

Please provide concise answers. Do explain obvious concepts. You can assume that I am knowledgable about most programming topics.

Whenever you write Typescript code, make sure to
- use ESM imports
- define interface in a separate file
- use Tailwind CSS for styling
- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
- document the code
- use English for comments, documentation and code
- use common and understandable variable, method and component names
- orientate yourself on the existing code base to remain consistent with the existing code base
