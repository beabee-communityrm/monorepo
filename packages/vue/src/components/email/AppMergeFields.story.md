# AppMergeFields

Display available merge fields for email templates in a grouped format. Merge fields are placeholders (format: `*|FIELD_NAME|*`) that get replaced with dynamic values at runtime.

## Purpose

This component provides a user-friendly interface for inserting merge fields in email templates. It is designed to be used within a dropdown context, such as in the `AppRichTextEditor` component.
